<h1 align="center">Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Andy Schwedler</h1>
<h3 align="center">A web dev student from Munich</h3>
<p align="center">Boot Camp Alumni and Explorer</p>

<p align="center">
...based in Munich (Bavaria, Germany)
</p>
<p align="center">
As a Sales & Project Manager, with professional experience in the IT world, I worked in interdisciplinary teams. I was able to shape and implement my experience and ideas in operational processes.</p>

<p align="center"> I chose a coding boot camp because I didn't want to be a bystander forever. As a person, I'm interested in the big picture. To do this, you also have to understand the task of each pixel. I was able to demonstrate my diligence and commitment during this time in order to achieve my goal and become a Frontend Developer</p>

<ul align="center"> please have a look at my latest repository:

<p align="center"> <strong>The remaining repositories are not relevant and do not represent my current skill level, but they show my progress over the time.</strong></p>
