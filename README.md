<h1 align="center">Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Andy Schwedler</h1>
<h3 align="center">A web dev student from Munich</h3>

<p>
...based in Munich (Bavaria, Germany)

<p>
During my time as project manager and field-engineer I gained wide operating experience working with international teams and customers. I made the decision to start a new career path as Web Developer and joined the neuefische Web Development Boot Camp. After completing the bootcamp I'm happy I did.

The other repositories are not relevant and do not represent my skill level, but they show my progress over the time..
